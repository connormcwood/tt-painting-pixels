## README

## Dev Dependency
- Jest is used to unit test the project

## Known Limitations
- Due to the use of padStart a hard coded value of 2 is used which means that should the gridContainer max length be more than two digits the console logging will be off.
- Unicode square is used to display Cell colours


## Additional Notes
- Personal Preference is not to use ES6 getters and setters because personally I find the obj.method syntax as a setter unsettling.
